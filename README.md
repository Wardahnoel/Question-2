# Difference btw these 3 method 
Method 1: A simple method that is a direct recursive implementation mathematical recurrence relation.
Time Complexity: Exponential, as every function calls two other functions.

Method 2: (Use Dynamic Programming)
Time complexity: O(n) for given n
Auxiliary space: O(n)

Method 3: (Space Optimized Method 2)
We can optimize the space used in method 2 by storing the previous two numbers
Time Complexity: O(n) 
Extra Space: O(1)
